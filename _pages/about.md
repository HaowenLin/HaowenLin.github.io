Hi! My name is Haowen. Currently, I am a undergaduate student at USC with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Business Finance with supervision under Professor Yao-Yi Chiang and Professor Satish. My research interests over the last few years have been in data science, specifically in data analysis on geographic datasets and information integration.
