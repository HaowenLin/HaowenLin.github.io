  Hi! My name is Haowen. Currently, I am a undergaduate student at USC with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Business Finance with supervision under Professor Yao-Yi Chiang and Professor Satish. My research interests over the last few years have been in data science, specifically in data analysis on geographic datasets and information integration. More information is available in my curriculum vitae.
